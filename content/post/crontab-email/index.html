<p>To keep track of the spread of Coronavirus on campus, my employer has asked every faculty person to provide a <em>daily</em> report of health-status via email. Yes, this means sending an email every day saying “I’m still healthy!” to a designated faculty member in the department, who must then verify everyone has responded that day and hunt down those who haven’t.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Having to send these daily emails made me go back and re-learn something I had tackled long-ago but forgotten: how to set up my computer to automatically run an R script at a scheduled date/time.</p>
<p>I originally did this in graduate school to scrape millions of tweets at given time intervals in the run-up to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Colombian_peace_agreement_referendum">October 2016 Colombian “peace” referendum</a>. The result was a lot of data and this cute graph that I haven’t been able to publish anywhere.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
