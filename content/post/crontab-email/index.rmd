To keep track of the spread of Coronavirus on campus, my employer has asked every faculty person to provide a *daily* report of health-status via email. Yes, this means sending an email every day saying "I'm still healthy!" to a designated faculty member in the department, who must then verify everyone has responded that day and hunt down those who haven't.^[If this sounds inefficient to you, you are right.] Having to send these daily emails made me go back and re-learn something I had tackled long-ago but forgotten: how to set up my computer to automatically run an R script at a scheduled date/time. 


I originally did this in graduate school to scrape millions of tweets at given time intervals in the run-up to the [October 2016 Colombian "peace" referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Colombian_peace_agreement_referendum). The result was a lot of data and this cute graph that I haven't been able to publish anywhere.^[Reviewer consensus seems to be: "nice, but I don't see what it adds to the paper". They are probably right.]

So, here's the set-up for the recurring email problem using `R` and `crontab`, but you can easily adapt the solution to other needs. 


## Step 1: Sending Emails


Sending emails with R is made easy by the `gmailr` package. 


## Step 2: Recurring Tasks with Crontab
