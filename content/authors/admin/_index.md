I'm an assistant professor of political science at [The University of California, Davis](https://ps.ucdavis.edu/) where I research and teach on security, development, and research methods. I am also affiliated with the [DevLab@Duke](https://www.devlabduke.com/), where I collaborate on the design and evaluation of international development programs. 


I was born in Cali, Colombia, grew up in Cali/South Florida, and have lived in Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, and now California. Outside of work, I love music, travel, cooking, and the outdoors.
